1.The backend files can be found in the address folder.
2.The entire backend was built using th Laravel Framework.
3. I skipped the authentication part since 
4. You would have to create a database in your localhost and run the php artisan migrate to migrate the database tables. Database name can be found in the .env file (address_db)
5. For the url to work with the backend, You would have to change the base url in the AppConfig.java file in the android to the desired localhost.
6. Kindly let me know if you have any other questions.
